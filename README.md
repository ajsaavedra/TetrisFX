# TetrisFX
This is a recreation of the game of Tetris done entirely in Java using the JavaFX platform. Like the original, players can move defined
blocks left and right, down, rotate or completely drop them. In this Java app, the player can also see the next block in the queue, and also
hold the current block for later.
